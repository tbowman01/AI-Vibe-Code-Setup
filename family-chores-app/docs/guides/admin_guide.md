## 1. Introduction

This guide is intended for administrators of the Family Chores Application. It provides comprehensive information on how to set up, configure, and manage the application to ensure optimal functionality and user experience.

### 1.1 Purpose

The administrator's role is critical for:
- Setting up the application environment
- Managing user accounts and access
- Configuring system settings
- Monitoring system performance
- Ensuring data integrity and security
- Troubleshooting issues

### 1.2 Admin vs. Parent Role

It's important to understand the distinction between the Admin role and the Parent role:

- **Admin**: Has system-level access to configure the application, manage all users, and access technical settings. This role is typically assigned to the primary account holder or IT administrator.
- **Parent**: Has family-level access to manage chores, rewards, and family members. Parents cannot access system-level configurations or manage users outside their family.

An account can have both Admin and Parent roles simultaneously.
